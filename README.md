# MotorShieldCode
This is the bare bones code for using the motor shield with the Arduino to control two DC motors.
Note that I did not include values for the Arduino pins because this can change depending on
individual robot setup. Also, you don't need PWM pins for the motors as the analogWrite takes
care of that. The pins you connect with the motor shield are the digital pins.
The motor shield model number is L298N Duel H-Bridge.
